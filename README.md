# ☢️ Radioactive Krunker Client
![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-no-red.svg)

## Features
Currently the features listed below are present.
- Uncapped FPS
- Alt Manager
- CSS Browser
- Plugins Browser
 - Local Mods (like Resource Swapper)
- Auto Update-Checking

#### Local mods
This feature works just like the resource swapper in other clients, the difference is that it loads the files to swap as a zip just like krunker loads mods that are not uploaded to krunker.

All tabs and settings can be accessed either through the splash screen or through ingame settings tab > client. 

Alt manager accounts can be logged into by clicking login button in krunker.
